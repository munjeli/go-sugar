# gosugar
So many of the things I like about Go also make it painful for coding interviews. The lack of sugar and iterators implies efficiency comes from writing custom libraries for your infrastructure. While many companies say you can write the technical responses in 'any language', they persistently define infrastructure problems as scripting in python.

That's a drag, and reflects the backwards attitudes about automation in the industry. But making lemonade, I've been writing more generic methods as a collection of helpers based on stupid interview questions. Most dubious is the `DateDuration` object for the time library, which is really useful for interviews and totally not something you should ever use in production.

# sugar
I'm back at the stage where I'm doing a lot of annoying interviews and trying to explain what, exactly, I program on the cloudz while looking for a new contract. Generally speaking, I don't have to parse anything, I just talk to machines. There's no human input. And I don't really deal with large arrays because infrastructure control services don't ever get to use memory, I mean, what if I wrote a thing on a server that gobbled all the memory and the applications crashed? Naughty DevOps. 

Really it's all about state machines and error handling. So I made this library so I can pull it in and pass interviews with uppity java engineers who claim that syntactic noodling like that is 'computer science.' I thought computer science was like, Djikstra's algorithm, but apparently it's just maps or strings :(
